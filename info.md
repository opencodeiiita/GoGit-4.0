I am a technical engineering student with a keen interest in a wide range of topics, especially in the world of sports and games. Along with my passion for engineering, I enjoy exploring various fields and staying updated with current trends and events.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active participant in open-source contributions. I enjoy collaborating on projects that help enhance my skills and contribute to the community. I am particularly keen on gaining hands-on experience and learning from real-world scenarios.

I am also a passionate sports enthusiast, and I love to watch and follow all kinds of sports and games. This broad interest helps me stay connected to different cultures and understand team dynamics and strategies.

Iâ€™m always open to new learning opportunities, whether they come from technical projects, open-source collaborations, or my interests in sports.
